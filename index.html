            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This study explores the relationship between proximity to facilities recorded by the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) in New York City and the vulnerability of residents to adverse health outcomes. Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, the analysis maps the locations of TRI facilities alongside demographic, environmental, and health data. By examining areas within 1 to 2 kilometers of facilities and assessing factors such as population density, socioeconomic variables, and asthma hospitalization rates, the study reveals patterns of vulnerability, particularly in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of low-income and minority populations. The findings demonstrate a spatial correlation between proximity to TRI facilities and health risks, underscoring the need for targeted public health interventions and stronger environmental policies. This research highlights the importance of environmental justice initiatives to address disparities in exposure and health outcomes, advocating for safer, more equitable communities across NYC.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">PM2.5 air pollution poses severe health risks, especially in densely populated global regions. This project utilizes GIS to map and analyze the spatial distribution of PM2.5 pollution across Asia, focusing on areas with unhealthy air quality levels and high population density. The study identifies critical areas where exposure to PM2.5 is most harmful to vulnerable population's health risk in the future. The findings aim to inform public health initiatives about air pollution impacts in Asia’s most vulnerable regions.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Urban environments significantly impact residents’ health. This project investigates the relationship between neighborhood health and tree density in New York City, utilizing LiDAR data and Community Health Survey data. Health scores were determined by measuring ten Community Health Survey categories, each scored from 1 (unhealthy) to 4 (healthy) based on percentiles, and aggregated to obtain overall scores ranging from 10 to 40 per neighborhood. Tree canopy coverage was assessed using zonal histograms in QGIS, focusing exclusively on tree canopy pixels and standardizing the results to square footage. Employing Python with Pandas and Matplotlib, the study explored correlations between tree coverage and health scores. Visualizations include choropleth maps and scatter plots illustrating the spatial and statistical relationships. Results revealed a subtle positive correlation between tree coverage and health scores, with notable outliers in Manhattan that skewed the overall relationship. These findings suggest that while increased tree coverage is generally associated with better health outcomes, other factors may influence community health in specific neighborhoods.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Food deserts are areas with low-income and low-access to affordable, nutritious food, and are linked to significant health disparities. This is due to food deserts often leading to poorer dietary outcomes and, consequently, shorter life expectancies. This study investigates the relationship between food deserts, poverty rates, and life expectancy by comparing two states, Mississippi, with the lowest life expectancy at birth in the U.S. (74.9 years), and Connecticut, with one of the highest (80.9 years). Despite Connecticut’s higher population density and smaller geographic size, the state has more supermarkets per capita than Mississippi, with 9,678 people per supermarket compared to Mississippi’s 13,103. Furthermore, 35.2% of Mississippi’s population lives more than 10 miles from a supermarket, whereas only 1.5% of Connecticut’s population faces similar geographic barriers. These findings suggest that while both food access and poverty rate play a role in health outcomes, the correlation is more pronounced in states with higher levels of food insecurity. This highlights the importance of improving supermarket access in low-income areas as a strategy to reduce health disparities.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Harmful algal events are occurring throughout the world. Also known as HAEs, they are caused in part by global warming, I specifically look at the temperature increase of the world’s water surfaces. My analysis includes adding global monthly water surface temperatures, averaging them by year for the past 15 years, and then plotting points of harmful algal events as provided by UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission member states in the Harmful Algal Event Database (HAEDAT). Each of the data points (where longitude and latitude coordinates were provided) are sized based on sampled values of the specific areas in which they fall on the map of temperatures. Larger circles represent a higher number of degrees above the norm for surface water temperatures, indicating that HAEs are related to warmer waters.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The acquistion of land in the United States of America is a brutal history filled with violence and genocide. Native American Indigenous people in the continental United States were slaughtered, displaced, exploited by United States colonizers for the commodification of their land. Their cultures, tribes, and homes were lost in the process. They continue to struggle to recover from this targeted displacement and dehumanization. A visualization and quantitative calculation of the amount of land Indigenous people lost was the primary focus of this project. The largest amount of land cession occurred during the 19th century. Producing maps in 20 years segments displaying the amount of land loss allows us to understand the ways in which we currently occupy a land that was not originally ours. The result concludes how many square miles indigenous people started with in the 1790s in comparison to the 2010s. </p>
